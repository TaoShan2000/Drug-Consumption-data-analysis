# Drug-Consumption-data-analysis
Final project, R for Data Science class

Project Discription: Your group will choose a dataset of your interest. The UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository contains

some datasets that you may use. You are also encourage to find other datasets from other sources. Ideally,
the dataset should not be too small and contains more than 1000 observations.
The project requires you to perform some data analysis on your chosen dataset. You have to submit a report
and do a presentation via zoom. In your report and presentation, you should include
1. Introduction of your problem (motivation and importance of the problem)
2. Description of the dataset and your data wrangling (if any)
3. A brief description of the methods used for the analysis
4. Results of the data analysis
5. Discussion section that summarizes the most important findings, discuss any limitations and possible
improvements.

For the data analysis part, you may do some of the following:
1. Data visualization
2. Formulate some hypotheses and perform hypothesis testings
3. Perform some statistical analysis
4. Apply some machine learning methods for classification, regression, and/or clustering.
5. For 3 and 4, you may compare different methods.
6. For 3 and 4, you should evaluate the performance of your methods.
